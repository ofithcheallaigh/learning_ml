    "This is an equation for a trend line, or a slope on and xy axis. In this equation, $y$ is the dependent variable (DV), it is what we are trying to explain. $x$ is the independent variable (IV). We assume the independent variable is causing the dependant variable to change. Since this is simple linear regression, we only have one independent variable. $b_1$ is a coefficient for the indepent variable. This coeffeicient tells us how a unit change in $x_1$ effects a unit change in $y$. "
